Use Elementor to design your complete website. Reuse header/footer on all pages. No theme required.

== Description ==

This is a free plugin for **[Elementor Page Builder](https://elementor.com/pro/?ref=1164&campaign=readme)**.

It provides two things:

- A full site builder using Elementor (design your entire website without a Theme)
- Adds extra widgets to Elementor (e.g. Tooltip, Navbar, Mailchimp, Modal Popups, Page Slider, etc..)

Watch this introduction video that covers some of the basics:

Design your entire website without a theme. Easily apply a Style to every page of your site automatically using the drag and drop editor.

= How to create a website design without a WordPress theme: =

- Go to the StylePress > Styles menu.
- Click "Create New Style".
- Design your layout using the Easy Elementor Drag & Drop editor.
- Add the "Inner Content" widget to the area that will display your content.
- Go to StylePress > Settings
- Apply your Style to the "Global" area

= Tips: =

- Make sure "Remove Theme CSS" is ticked in StylePress > Settings.
- If you find it hard to set global font default, go into Elementor > Settings and tick "Disable Global Colors" and "Disable Global Fonts". Then install the "Easy Google Fonts" plugin and set all your defaults from Appearance > Typography.
